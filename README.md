# Olympic Medal Victory Points Ladder
Simple python script which uses the (MedalBot)[http://www.medalbot.com/] API to calculated Victory Points for each country at the Olympics.

I think this is a fairer way of calculating a country-by-country leaderboard.
It should be noted that the IOC does not actually tally based on country, it is meant to be per athlete, however basically everyone these days goes of per country (yay, patriotism!) 

## What are VPs?
Victory Points is a system which awards points for placing
6 for a gold (1st)
4 for a silver (2nd)
2 for a bronze (3rd) 

## Why use VPs and not just tally up medals? 
VPs balance out what each medal is worth, meaning a country winning more golds is worth more than one that has twice as many bronzes.
Yet under the current system, both would be worth equal. Rediculous. 

Also means Australia is higher. Yay Aussie!
